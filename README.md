### Back-end leaning teamplayer and developer in the making 
<p>Nice to bump into you 👋 </p>
<p>Former business developer turned software engineer. Below is stuff that I've been working with code - all project unless otherwise mentioned have been solo projects i.e. the code produced is my own. In addition to software development, I am keen on learning how to become a contributor that can elevate the whole team as a developer. 🌱 </p>

Besides programming I like cooking, dancing and hanging with my friends like playing DnD. 🐉
